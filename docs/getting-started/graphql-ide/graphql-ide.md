# Testing queries using a GraphQL IDE

Use a GraphQL Integrated Developer Environment (IDE) to test and validate queries during development. 

Here are the basic steps to set up, download a GraphQL IDE, and send a test query for your test company.

## Step 1: Set up your app in the Intuit Developer Portal

If you haven't already, [get a QuickBooks Online company](../authentication/) for testing, [create your app](../authentication/), and get your app's [**Client ID** and **Client Secret**](../authentication/). 

## Step 2: Get a GraphQL IDE

There are many GraphQL IDEs available. Use the one you prefer. 

Here are a couple we recommend. In particular, we prefer Insomnia for its collection and built-in authorization features. 

* [Set up and test with Insomnia](./insomnia)

## Step 3: Send a test query

After you install a GraphQL IDE, use the sample queries from the [Schema Entities](../../schema-entities/) folder to test get data for your test company..
