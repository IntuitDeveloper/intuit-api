# Learn about Intuit scopes

In GraphQL, scopes limit what data your app can read and update. Instead of getting broad permissions for everything, set granular permissions so your app only focuses on what's necessary.

Here are the current scopes for Intuit API. 

| **Scope**                                     | **Description**                                                        | **Sensitive data**       |
|:----------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------|
| time-tracking.time-entry.read                               | Grants access to read all time entires                                 | |
| time-tracking.time-entry                | Grants access to read and write time entries                           |  |
